# Media Interaction

>The Media item allows the test-taker to view a multimedia presentation (image slide show, YouTube video, etc.), usually in connection with another interaction item.

**Step 1:** From the Common Interactions menu in the Library Panel, drag the *Media* icon onto the blank Item and drop the resulting box in the blue field that appears when the item is dragged over it.

This creates a Resource Manager upload window, through which the test author may select a media file that is already in the resource library, or upload to the library a new media file from elsewhere on that user*s personal computer, or from a favorite website (such as in YouTube). Once uploaded, a new Media Interaction item window will appear. In the top, there will be a field for placing in a question at the top, and the media element below that.

**Step 2:** Fill in the question field. 

This will describe the task given to the test-taker ("View carefully the following film", "Listen to the inflections in the following sound bite", etc.).

**Step 3:** In the Properties Panel, select if the media device should *autostart* (begin playing on opening the item), *loop* (play over and over again), and be allowed to pause, and if looped, how many times it should play through before stopping. 

These property options will affect how the test-taker views the media object while it is playing.

**Step 4:** If desired, add a further interaction below the media item.

Usually, a media item is used to present a film or sound clip, from which a series of questions may be added. To do this, drag the appropriate other Item from the Interactions menu on the right.

**Step 5:** Click the blue *Done* button.

When this is done, you can preview what your Media item looks like.

To do this, first go to the Action Bar line above the work canvas and find the *Save* button on the far left of the segment above that canvas. You will want to click the *Preview* button next to the *Save* button. This will bring up a dialog box that will ask you to save changes before previewing your work. Click the blue *Save* button. You'll then be able to review the Item you've created as it will be viewed by the test-taker.

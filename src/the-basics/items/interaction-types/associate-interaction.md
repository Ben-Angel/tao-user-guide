## Associate Interaction ##

The Associate Interaction Item demonstrates the test-taker’s ability to match words or phrases that are associative with each other. 

**Step 1:** From the Common Interactions menu in the Library Panel, drag the ‘Associate’ icon (the second row left option) onto the blank Item and drop the resulting box in the blue field that appears when you drag the ‘Choice’ element over it.

This opens a new Associate Interaction window. By default, the window will begin on Question mode (rather than Response mode) and two ‘tile’ options will show below a question field, which by default should be where the cursor is located. 

**Step 2:** Fill in the question field describing the associations (matches) being sought. 

This could be in the form of a question (‘*Which country goes with which capital city?*’) or instructional (‘*Match the country with the capital city.*’).

**Step 3:** Fill in the ‘Option tiles’ for the question. If more than two are needed (as will often be the case), select ‘Add choice’ however many times is needed to provide all the options to be made available for the test-taker.

Often the best strategy is to add the appropriate matches first (in the example above, the correct countries and capitals) in separate tiles, and then add the incorrect (unmatched) options after that. 

**Step 4:** Click Response in the Actions Subheader to shift to Response mode.

This will provide all the Option tiles created in the previous step, and the first associate pair to be filled in the next step.

**Step 5:** Click the first item to be associated, and then on the first box. Click its match (association), and then on the second box.

This will provide the first set of correct responses, and open up the option to fill in a second set of associated items. Fill in all the correct associations, leaving unmatched the incorrect associations.

**Step 6:** In the Properties Panel, check the box instructing to ‘Shuffle Answers’. 

This will disguise the matched pairs entered in for the question. If this is not clicked, how you’ve entered the tiles in will be how they will appear to the test-taker.

**Step 7:** Click the blue ‘Done’ button.

When this is done, you can preview what your Associate item looks like.

To do this, first go to the Actions Subheader line above the work canvas and find the ‘Save’ button on the far left of the segment above that canvas. You will want to click the ‘Preview’ button next to the ‘Save’ button. This will bring up a dialog box that will ask you to save changes before previewing your work. Click the blue ‘Save’ button. You’ll then be able to review the Item you’ve created as it will be viewed by the test-taker.

# Choice Interaction #

>Choice Interaction, most frequently referred to as the multiple choice question (MCQ), presents a test question type that has been made popular by such time-honored exams as the SAT, ACT, PSAT/NMSQT, etc. Creating a Choice Item is a relatively straight-forward step-by-step process. 


**Step 1:** From the Common Interactions menu in the Left Frame, drag the *Choice* icon (the upper left option) onto the blank Item and drop the resulting box in the blue field that appears when you drag the *Choice* element over it.

This provides the selection boxes for your multiple choice question. By default, the cursor should be on the question field above three answer *choices*. 


**Step 2:** Enter the question in the question field at the top of the item.

Note that a style icon (the letter *A* next to the trash can on the left) allows you to adjust text in several ways (for text formatting options, click here).


**Step 3:** Click *choice #1* text to edit the field it is in. Insert the first answer option in this field. Repeat this step with the other choices to populate those fields.

This interaction starts with three choices in which to place alternative answers. However, you can add more options by clicking the *Add Choice* blue field below the first three choices (keep clicking until the desired number of choices appear in the item), and you can delete options by clicking the trash can icon to the right of the choice you wish to delete. You'll note that the same style icon exists within the Properties Panel on the far right.


**Step 4:** On the far right (on the Action Bar, *Style Editor*), select in the Interaction Properties pull down frame the number of items that the user will be asked to provide.

To do this, you'll select the minimum number of answers (it can be zero, if desired), and the maximum number of answers (which can be up to the number of options provided) that the test-taker can provide for this question. To set up a radio button quiz item, select minimum of 1 and maximum of 1.

Additionally, you'll notice above this in the Interaction Properties pull down frame is the option to *shuffle choices*. This allows the test publisher to negate the use of tried test-taker strategies of guessing like "always select B if you don't know" or for cheating between earlier test-takers and those taking the test after them. Where the order isn't important, this is recommended. (Realize that to use this option, you won't want to prefix answers with A., B. … or 1., 2. … etc.)


**Step 5.** On the Item header, find the word *Response* on the far right, next to the trash can (avoid clicking the trash can, as this will lead to deleting the item). Click *Response*.

This activates options for indicating the correct answer for use in scoring.


**Step 6.** Select the correct answer and click the box ahead of it.

You can select more than one answer.


**Step 7.** Click anywhere outside the Work Space. This will produce in the Properties Panel (to the right) a check box that can be set if the interaction is to be time dependent (completed within a certain interval) by the test-taker. Check if this is the case.

Time dependence is useful for limiting the time in which a test-taker has to get through interactions within the examination. This will be covered in greater detail in Deliveries.


**Step 8.** Click *Done* to finish the Item.

You'll want to review your work at this point. You can edit the text already there by clicking on it. Again, click *Done* once you have finished editing.


**Step 9.** Click *Preview* to see what the test-taker will see. For more on previewing, see this function's designated section.

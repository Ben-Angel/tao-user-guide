# Choice Interaction #

>Choice Interaction, frequently referred to as multiple choice question (MCQ), presents a test question type that has been made popular by such time-honored exams as the SAT, ACT, PSAT/NMSQT, etc. Choice interactions are preferable to free-response test items in cases where more test questions need to be fit into a shorter-duration exam period. Where time is of the essence is where this type of testing Item is particularly useful.

**Step 1:** From the Common Interactions library, drag the *Choice* icon (the upper left option) onto the blank Item and drop the resulting box in the resulting blue field. This displays a set of selection fields for your multiple choice question.

**Step 2:** Enter the question in the question field at the top of the Interaction canvas.

Note that the A icon on the right allows you to put your text in bold or in italic for instance, or insert a picture.  

**Step 3:** This interaction provides by default three choices in which to place alternative answers. Click *choice #1* text to edit the field it is in. Type the first answer option in this field. Repeat this step with the other choices to populate those fields.

If more than three choices are needed, you can add more options by clicking the *Add Choice* blue field below the first three choices (keep clicking until the desired number of choices appear in the test item), and you can delete options by clicking the trash can icon to the right of the choice you wish to delete. As with the question field, the A icon on the right allows you to put your text in bold or in italic for instance, or insert a picture.  

**Step 4:** When all your choices have been defined, go into the properties panel and open Interaction Properties. Define here the number of choices that the user will be asked to provide.

By default, your MCQ is made of checkboxes, with a max of 0 (that means that your test-taker can select as many as choices he wants) and a min of 0 (that means that your test-taker is not required to answer). 

To set up a radio button quiz item, select a maximum of 1. This means that your test-taker will be not allowed to select more than one choice, and you will see on your item canvas that radio buttons will be displayed.

Tips -> If you question is required, the Min choice should be at least "1" . If you question is not required, select "0". 

Additionally, you'll notice above this in the Properties Panel that there is the option to *shuffle choices*.  Check this option to make your choices appear in a different order for each test-taker. This allows the test publisher to negate the use of tried test-taker strategies of guessing like "always select B if you don't know" or for cheating between earlier Test-takers and those taking the test after them. Where the order isn't important, this is recommended. 

Tips -> Realize that to use this option, you won't want to prefix answers with A., B. … or 1., 2. … etc.

**Step 5.** Now to define the scoring options, on the Interaction Header, click on *Response* on the far right (avoid clicking on the nearby trash can, as this will lead to deleting the item).

This activates options for indicating the correct answer for use in scoring.

**Step 6.** Select the correct answer by clicking the box ahead of it.

If you aren't using radio buttons, you can select more than one answer.

**Step 7.** Click *Done* once you have finish your Choice Interaction.

You'll want to review your work at this point. You can edit the text already there by clicking on it. Again, click *Done* once you have finished editing.

**Step 8.** To see what the test-taker will see click *Preview* in the Item Action Bar.

 **Step 7.** Click anywhere outside the Work Space. This will produce in the Properties Panel (to the right) a check box that can be set if the interaction is to be time dependent (completed within a certain interval) by the test-taker. Check if this is the case.

Time dependence is useful for limiting the time in which a test-taker has to get through interactions within the examination. This will be covered in greater detail in Deliveries. -->

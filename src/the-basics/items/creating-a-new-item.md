# Creating a new item

>Questions and other forms of *interaction* are considered the main element of *Item* components of larger *Tests*. These basic elements are first created, and then combined for use in assessing Test-taker ability to acquire understanding. Each interaction type, and the procedure used to create it, differs to some degree from other interaction types, but there are certain steps that are held in common for authoring all interactions. 

**Step 1:** In the Assessment Assembly Bar, click the *Items* icon.

This will bring up the last interaction in which you, or the user before you, edited. However, here you are creating a new test Item.

**Step 2:** In the *Library*, click the *class* or folder that the interaction (and associated test) applies. 

This will bring up a new Actions Bar that includes the following options: Properties, New Class, New Item, Export, and Import.

**Step 3:** Click on *New Item* in the Actions Bar.

This will bring up a new dialog box that gives you the option to name, or *label* your item, and radio buttons that give you the choice between selecting the model type for this item as either QTI or Open Web Item. QTI format allows for easier and greater flexibility of use in various TAO products.

**Step 4:** After naming and selecting model type, save.

This produces an empty item that you can now populate with questions. Close the dialog box reminder that the item has been saved before moving on.

**Step 5:** In the Actions Bar, find the option that reads *Authoring* and click it.

This will produce the empty Items page upon which youâ€™ll place your interaction. Your focus should next rest on the Item Library to the left, which shows as a default the *Common Interaction* catalogue. Below this are the *Inline Interactions* and *Graphic Interactions* and *Custom Interactions* catalogues, which are hidden behind a grey bar.

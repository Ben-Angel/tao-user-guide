# Modal feedback

>A ‘Modal Feedback’ is an automated response message given to encourage the test-taker if that person answers a question correctly or alert the test-taker if that person answers incorrectly to a question. It may be set to be triggered for just about any question in a test.

>The option to use Modal Feedback usually presents itself when authoring the Response portion to a given Item. If available, it will appear in the Response Properties Panel on the right, at the bottom of the panel. If the option presents itself, and it is desired, the following steps are needed to activate Modal Feedback for a given question.

>**Step 1:** Find the Modal Feedbacks section in the Properties Panel. Click on ‘Add a modal feedback’.

>This opens an ‘if-then’ statement, which allows the test-author to create a message when the test-taker gets the answer correct, or when that person gets it incorrect. It also allows the test-author to assign a message if the test-taker achieves a particular score, is over a particular score, or is under that score, if the response processing is set to ‘Map Response’.

>**Step 2:** Select the ‘if-statement’ trigger condition. Then select the ‘then-statement’ response.

>Click the ‘Feedback’ button located after the word ‘then’. This will bring up a pop-up window that asks for a ‘Modal Feedback Title’ and ‘Some feedback text’. Replace the placeholder texts with the intended feedback to be given for the defined trigger condition.

>**Step 3:** If desired, an ‘else’ statement can be added.

>To do this, click the ‘Else’ hypertext below the ‘Feedback’ button.  This will bring up a second ‘Feedback’ button, within which a similar pop-up window will present itself. Type in the applicable ‘Modal Feedback Title’ and ‘Some feedback text’ for when the test-taker fails to meet the conditions set by the trigger ‘if-statement’.

>**Step 4:** If a second, third, or more Modal Feedback statement is desired, click on the ‘Add a modal feedback’ hypertext and repeat Steps 2 and 3.

>This will allow the test-author to present different messages in conditions different from the initial Modal Feedback ‘if-then’ statement. It should be noted that if a score matched more than one condition, both sets of feedback may present itself. Experimentation or, specifically, testing out how the test-taker might answer an item’s question may prove useful in setting up a desired modal feedback response, and avoiding one that is undesirable.

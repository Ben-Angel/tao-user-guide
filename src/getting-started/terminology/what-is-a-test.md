# What is a test?

>A test is a group of Items with an associated set of rules that determine which of the items the candidate sees, in what order, and in what way the candidate interacts with them. The rules describe the valid paths (order of questions) through the test, when responses are submitted for response processing (grading), and when (if at all) feedback is to be given.

Assessments in TAO are assembled from individual Items that are later delivered to test-takers through an automated delivery system. Among the important considerations here is selection of an appropriate title that helps test-takers accurately identify the assessment, particularly should it appear in a list of other assessments that the test-taker must also take at the same time. Also important are time limitations and feedback used to help with successful interaction by the test-taker with the test itself.

Ease of navigation by the test-taker must also be given careful consideration. If there are enough items within a test, they should be sorted and grouped according to a logical set of criteria. Test designers must also consider whether the test-taker will need to follow a linear path (a specific question order with no option to revisit questions later) or if they can instead use a non-linear route (where questions can be answered in any order and revisited if desired).

Lastly, test design must consider the method of submission, where interactions are either scored simultaneously at the test-taker's completion of a test part or graded as each item is completed. The former simulates how paper-based tests work, with feedback and grading taking place after the last question is answered. The latter allows feedback while the test is in progress.

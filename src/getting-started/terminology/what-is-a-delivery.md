# What is a delivery?


*"A delivery is the process that coordinates the rendering and delivery of tests and the evaluation of responses to interactions to produce scores and feedback."* - Based on the Question and Test Interoperability standard, published by IMS Global


>Deliveries effectively define the lifecycle of an item session. 

This cycle begins when the test-taker becomes eligible for test delivery, which is set within the delivery during its creation. In simplest terms, it continues through the test-taker's interaction with the test's items selected for the candidate until test results for all interactions are determined. In some instances, more than one attempt to interact may be allowed, in which case, the delivery lifecycle continues until there are no remaining attempts permitted. It finishes with the recording of results, which may or may not be displayed to the test-taker (but is definitely made available to the test administrator).

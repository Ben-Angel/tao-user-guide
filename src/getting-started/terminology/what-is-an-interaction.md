# What is an interaction?

>Interactions allow the candidate to interact with the item. Through an interaction, the candidate selects or constructs a response. The candidate's responses are stored in the response variables. Each interaction is associated with (at least) one response variable.

First and foremost, the term *interaction* should not be considered interchangeable with *item*. Interactions can serve as a basic unit of test-taker response, particularly with respect to scoring. Items may be made up of one interaction or more than one related interactions. As such, they are not equivalent.

Interactions are classified in four categories: simple, text-based, graphical, and miscellaneous. There are more than 17 interactions recognized by the QTI standard.

# What is an item?

*"An item is a set of interactions (possibly empty) collected together with any supporting material and an optional set of rules for converting the candidate's response(s) into assessment outcomes."* - Question and Test Interoperability standard, published by IMS Global

>Items are the basic building blocks for assessments. They may contain one stand-alone interaction (called a *simple item*), or they may contain several closely-related interactions, all the same type or of a mixture of types (called a *composite item*). Of utmost importance here, the term *item* should not be considered interchangeable with *interaction*. 

Beyond interactions contained within them, Items include titles, images, and text that help the test-taker understand the expectations and context of the assessment material within it.

Items also include, within the interactions associated with them, the mechanisms used by TAO to score themselves. For simple items, this is relatively straight-forward, with correct answers adding, and incorrect answers not adding, to the test score. Scoring for a composite item using standard response templates (*match correct*, *map response*, or *map response point*) is often more complicated, but even at its most involved, this is little more than a summation of its parts.

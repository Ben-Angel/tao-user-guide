# What is an item?

>An item is a set of interactions (possibly empty) collected together with any supporting material and an optional set of rules for converting the candidate's response(s) into assessment *outcomes*. 

>(Question and Test Interoperability standard, published by IMS Global)

First and foremost, the term *item* should not be considered interchangeable with *interaction*. Items may contain one stand-alone interaction (called a *simple item*), or they may contain several closely-related interactions, all the same type or of a mixture of types (called a *composite item*). Items also include titles, images, and text that help the test-taker understand the expectations and context of the assessment material within it.

Scoring for a composite item using standard response templates (*match correct*, *map response*, or *map response point*) is essentially a summation of its parts.
